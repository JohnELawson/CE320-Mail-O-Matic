# CE320-Mail-O-Matic

Final coursework code uploaded for module CE320.

This program is essentially a 'mail merge' application. 

It takes an input csv of email addresses and other dynamically read columns. 

Using a email template, it then connects to a email server and sends the email out to every email in the csv file, while populating the variables in the email template, e.g. name, with the columns name from the csv file.
